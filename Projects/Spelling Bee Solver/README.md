<h1>Spelling Bee Solver</h1>

The [spelling bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) is an online game found on the NYT Games page. The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible by spelling out words using the letters provided. The rules of the game are:
*All words **MUST** contain the central letter.
*Words can only be made up of the letters provided. You don't have to use every letter and letters can be used multiple times.
*Words have to be at least 4 characters long
*4 letter words are worth 1 point each. Points for words over 4 characters long are worth the length of the word *(5 letter words = 5 points, etc)*
