# My plot

This is my second time trying out the weekly TidyTuesday challenge. I tried to graph the
relationship between how much of a country's population were connected to the internet
(as a way of indicating how technologically advanced the country is) compared to the
life expectancy. Overall a simple plot but getting used to ggplot and trying to manipulate
it without having to look things up all the time.
